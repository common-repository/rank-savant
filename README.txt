== Description ==
Rank Savant is the Local SEO tool that makes it fast, easy and inexpensive for any small business to turn their website into a search magnet and outrank competitors across their entire service area.

Most tools for managing websites are highly technical, overwhelming, and difficult to use unless you’re a web developer. Rank Savant is for busy small business managers who don’t have the time or desire to become an SEO expert, but also can’t justify hundreds or thousands a month on agency SEO services.
